# from-html-to-database
this is a basic example of how to take in data through an html form then use php to process it/send it to a database

# setup
first, clone the repo into your htdocs folder in xampp and start apache & mysql in the xampp control panel

then, copy and run the sql statements in sql.txt into the sql editor in phpmyadmin (you can run them all at once)

navigate to localhost/from-html-to-database/index.html in your browser, click the button to go to the form, then fill out and submit the form

you should see a message saying that a new user was added - to confirm this, click on the user_info table in the users database in phpmyadmin
